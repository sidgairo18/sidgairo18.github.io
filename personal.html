            I am a ardent believer in the philosphy that "In a healthy body, resides a healthy mind." To that end, I workout routinely (3-4 times a week) which is a mixture of weight training at the gym, performing calisthenics / gymnastics, running, cycling, swimming, indoor bouldering, and anything else that can get my heart racing and blood pumping ;) .
            <br><br>
            From the ages of 9-15 I actively played football (soccer) semi-professionally at my school, district level. I was part of the Garhwal Sporting Football Club based in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. At Garhwal Sporting F.C. I was fortunate enough to play with players who had represented the Indian National Football team at the Under-19 category. Additionally, I was also fortunate enough to play alongside and witness the greatness of a young <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anirudh_Thapa">Anirudh Thapa</a> who plays as a midfielder for the current senior men's Indian National Football team. However later life came about and I was pushed into a different world of studies and academia which I now enjoy thoroughly. I do watch football (I have been a Arsenal F.C. fan since 2005), and also try to play as and when I get the chance to.

            <b>CalElite</b>
            <br><br>
            This is a hybrid training program that I devised which combines a mixture of weighted training at the gym, and body-weight (calisthenics) exercises. You can download a free pdf of this program here - <a href="./CalElite.pdf">(pdf link here)</a>.
